If you need any helping begin working (like, cloning this repo and adding your commit), you are in the right place.

Git is a fantastic tool to manage rapid and complex software development. It helps controlling different versions of source code, and keeping developers away from troublesome file managements.

GitHub, as suggested by its name, is a free web host for Git. It allow Git users to easily commit, communicate, and collaborate. The thing that makes it different from any other previous ways of group code sharing is, it ACTUALLY WORKS. Unlike FTP or anything like that. Yeah, like, FTP.

To get these code on your machine, you need git installed. If you are a UNIX family OS user it should be perfectly easy.

Use this command to clone this repository to your machine, NOTE: replace [route] with where you want the files to be:

    $ git clone https://github.com/baboofei/ETSC-EMS.git [route]

... And there it is! Now set your IDE (hopefully RubyMine) to work in the [route] directory.

Once you've done some work on the code and want to upload it again back to Github, do

    $ git commit

Or if any new file [file] is added in the working directory, do

    $ git add [file]

To add it to the repo tracking list. Now, once you are done, do

    $ git push

To simply push it to GitHub! And that's it!
In case any modification is done by other contributors, do 

    $ git pull

To fetch the updated repo back to your machine.

And there you go!
